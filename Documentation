Documentation For Servo Motor Firmware

    Note: there are total of eight servo[servo1 to servo8]

Commands for servo in serial mode:
“$_servo_no_pwm_/n”//no can be from 0 to 8, and pwm value is 000 to 180.

Example:

 Serial.pirntln(“$ servo 1 180 /n”);//this will make servo 1 to move at 180 degree position.

commands for servo in i2c:
             it is same as in serial mode
	“$_servo_no_pwm_/n”//no can be from 0 to 8, and pwm value is 000 to 180.
	
	Example:

	Wire.beginTransmission(4); // transmit to device #4 i.e, our servo
  	Wire.write("$ servo 1 180 /n ");        
  	Wire.endTransmission();    // stop transmitting
  	delay(4000);

Commands for servo in spi mode : it is same as above 
Note:in spi mode the command ends with ‘\n’
          “$_servo_no_pwm_\n”     / /no can be from 0 to 8, and pwm value is 000 to 180.

Example:
char c;

digitalWrite(SS, LOW);    
 for (const char * p = "$ servo 1 170 \n" ; c = *p; p++)
    SPI.transfer (c);
  digitalWrite(SS, HIGH);
  
 delay(3000);
  
  digitalWrite(SS, LOW);    
 for (const char * p = "$ servo 3 170 \n" ; c = *p; p++)
    SPI.transfer (c);
  digitalWrite(SS, HIGH);


note :after each instruction in all the mode minimum of 3 seconds delay is required.
